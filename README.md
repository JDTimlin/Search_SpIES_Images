# Code to search the SpIES AORs for a particular RA/DEC

## This code requires SWARP to run along with recent versions of pyregion (v2.0 or greater) as well as astropy (v2.0.6 or greater)

### The official code to run and update is called SpIES_AOR_Search_cut.py. This code should run generally, however you will need to update the path of the AORs on your local machine in lines 227 and 230 in the Stack_AORs function as well as the path to SWARP at line 370
